# CoolStore Microservices - Ansible Installer
The series of scripts and Ansible playbooks in this repository are used to deploy the Red Hat CoolStore Microservices demo project. This project was born out of the complexity of maintaining a Bash shell script to provision the application. The playbooks utilize the roles and libraries from the *openshift-ansible* project which provide rich Ansible modules for manipulating Kubernetes resources.

## Pre-Install Setup

Make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Git
- Ansible 1.9+
- Python module "jmespath"
  * sudo pip install jmespath *or* sudo yum install python-jmespath
  * This is required for the json_query filter in Ansible

## Application Installation
All of the instructions in this section assume that you are using CDK 3.2 (minishift). You may use a remote OpenShift cluster as well.  Adjust IP addresses and ports as needed.

* Login to your openshift environment as the system administrator and create special accounts
```
$ oc login -u system:admin
$ oc create sa pv-recycler-controller -n openshift-infra
```
* Edit the vars.yml file and change any needed parameters
* Run the appropriate playbook

Choose from one of the following playbooks:
|===
| *Playbook Name*        | *Description*                                | *Min Memory* | *Min CPU* | *Projects*
| msa-min.yml            | Microservices Minimal                        | 4 GB         | 2 cores   | 1
| msa.yml                | Microservices                                | 8 GB         | 4 cores   | 1
| msa-cicd-eap-min.yml   | Microservices with CI/CD Minimal (Dev-Prod)  | 12 GB        | 6 cores   | 3
| msa-cicd-eap.yml       | Microservices with CI/CD (Dev-Test-Prod)     | 18 GB        | 8 cores   | 5
|===

```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts --tags "deploy" playbooks/msa.yml
```
Substitute the desired playbook in the command above.

Permissions were given to the *developer* user so you can work with the application with that account.

## Application De-Installation

* Login to your openshift environment as the system administrator.
* Run the appropriate playbook with the *undeploy* tag
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts --tags "undeploy" playbooks/msa.yml
```
